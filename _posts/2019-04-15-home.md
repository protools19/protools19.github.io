### Background

Understanding program behavior is critical to overcome the expected architectural and programming complexities, such as limited power budgets, heterogeneity, hierarchical memories, shrinking I/O bandwidths, and performance variability, that arise on modern HPC platforms. To do so, HPC software developers need intuitive support tools for debugging, performance measurement, analysis, and tuning of large-scale HPC applications. Moreover, data collected from these tools such as hardware counters, communication traces, and network traffic can be far too large and too complex to be analyzed in a straightforward manner. We need new automatic analysis and visualization approaches to help application developers intuitively understand the multiple, interdependent effects that algorithmic choices have on application correctness or performance.
The ProTools workshop combines two prior SC workshops: the Workshop on Visual Performance Analytics (VPA) and the Workshop on Extreme-Scale Programming Tools (ESPT).

The Workshop on Programming and Performance Visualization Tools (ProTools) intends to bring together HPC application developers, tool developers, and researchers from the visualization, performance, and program analysis fields for an exchange of new approaches to assist developers in analyzing, understanding, and optimizing programs for extreme-scale platforms.

### Workshop Topics

- Performance tools for scalable parallel platforms
- Debugging and correctness tools for parallel programming paradigms
- Scalable displays of performance data
- Case studies demonstrating the use of performance visualization in practice
- Program development tool chains (incl. IDEs) for parallel systems
- Methodologies for performance engineering
- Data models to enable scalable visualization
- Graph representation of unstructured performance data
- Tool technologies for extreme-scale challenges (e.g., scalability, resilience, power)
- Tool support for accelerated architectures and large-scale multi-cores
- Presentation of high-dimensional data
- Visual correlations between multiple data source
- Measurement and optimization tools for networks and I/O
- Tool infrastructures and environments
- Human-Computer Interfaces for exploring performance data
- Multi-scale representations of performance data for visual exploration
- Application developer experiences with programming and performance tools
